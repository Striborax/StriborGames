# StriborGames
A website with small games made in javascript.
Crashes a lot because I just started using javascript.

### GAME 1: BUBBLES
Move mouse to control player and collect blue circles.
Every blue circle = +1 score, if circle gets to other side it's -10 score.


### GAME 2: SHOOTER (under development)
Move with WASD, use mouse to shoot bullets and shrink enemies.
